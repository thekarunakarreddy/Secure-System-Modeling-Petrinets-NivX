# Secure-System-Modeling-Petrinets-NivX
Formal modelling and verification of a secure web-based system using Petri Nets. The project focuses on behaviour modelling using Snoopy and formal verification using Charlie, incorporating core secure design principles, system specification, and validation across different SDLC stages. Includes graphical Petri Net models and correctness analysis.
Modelled the behavior of a secure car rental web system using Petri Nets via the Snoopy tool, and performed formal verification using Charlie. Focused on applying formal methods across the SDLC to validate correctness, concurrency, and security properties of system components such as authentication, booking workflow, and payment flow. Project involved informal-to-formal specification translation, behavioural modeling, and model checking using graph-based transitions and conditions.
